All specifications on the project were met by the php pages.
- Created 5 input pages:
to add Actor/Director, to add Movie, Add comment, Add Actor-Movie relation and Add Movie-Director relation.
Each of these pages adds the specified entries (through user input) into the database CS143 as required. In the relations pages,
we used dropdowns to make the user choose a Movie/Actor/Director instead of them typing it in. This makes it easier to prevent input errors.
Moreover for these pages, duplicates are acceptable since we were not specifically asked to check for them.
- Created 2 Browsing Pages through a Search Page:
Added a search page that leads to links to Actors and Movies. These links reveal all information about the Actor or Movie
as required by the specifications.


Apart from the specs of the project, I added a navigation bar to make it easier for the users to navigate through the different
php pages. This navigation bar was used in all pages.

NOTE/Possible Issues:
In Actor-Movie Relations, the Actor dropdown that lets the user choose an Actor from a list of all possible actors takes a while to load.
This happens because there are so many actors and loading them in a dropdown menu from the database is bound to take some time.


Work distribution:

We split the input pages into 2 per person, and did 1 browsing page per person.
We collaborated our code and maintained consistency throughout.

Small Problems on collab:
The fact that we have to test the same code on two different local hosts made it inconvenient to
test code without physically sitting next to the partner.
